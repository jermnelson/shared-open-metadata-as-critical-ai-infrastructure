## Knowledge Graphs in Libraries, Museums, Galleries, and other Cultural Heritage Institutions 
In 2011, the Library of Congress released version 1.0 of the Bibliographic Framework vocabulary, shorted
to BIBFRAME, as a replacement for MARC in describing bibliographic entities like books, images, serials,
and other creative endeavors. BIBFRAME is a Resource Description Framework or RDF vocabulary that represents 
these endeavors as a directed graph made up subject-predicate-object triples.
