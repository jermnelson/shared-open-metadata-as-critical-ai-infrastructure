<h2><i class="bi-book"></i> Knowledge Graphs in Libraries, Museums, Galleries, and Other Cultural Heritage Institutions </h2>

In 2011, the Library of Congress released version 1.0[^VERSION_1] of the Bibliographic Framework vocabulary, shortened
to BIBFRAME, as a replacement for MARC in describing bibliographic entities such as books, images, serials,
and other creative endeavors. BIBFRAME is a Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabulary that represents 
these endeavors as a directed graph composed of subject-predicate-object triples. The BIBFRAME vocabulary 3.0 release
has been delayed due to the current United States Government shutdown but will reflect the experiences of catalogers using
BIBFRAME over the past 14 years. 


### Selected Museum Examples
The Getty Museum provides a Linked Open Data API gateway for entities in its collections, 
offering over 733,000 records in JSON-LD format[^GETTY]. Similarly, the Smithsonian American 
Art Museum provides linked open metadata for its collections[^SAAM] using the CIDOC Conceptual 
Reference Model[^CIDOC].
