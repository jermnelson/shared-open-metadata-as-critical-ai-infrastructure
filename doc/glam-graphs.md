<h2><i class="bi-book"></i> Knowledge Graphs in Libraries, Museums, Galleries, and other Cultural Heritage Institutions </h2>

In 2011, the Library of Congress released version 1.0[^VERSION_1] of the Bibliographic Framework vocabulary, shortened
to BIBFRAME, as a replacement for MARC in describing bibliographic entities like books, images, serials,
and other creative endeavors. BIBFRAME is a Resource Description Framework or RDF vocabulary that represents 
these endeavors as a directed graph made up subject-predicate-object triples. The BIBFRAME vocabulary 3.0 release
is delayed due to the current United States Government shutdown but represents the experiences of catalogers using
BIBFRAME over the past 14 years. 


### Selected Museums Examples
The Getty Museum provides a Linked Open Data API gateway for entities in their collections in JSON-LD
that covers over 733k records.[^GETTY]. Similar work by the Smithsonian American Art Museum provides 
their collections linked open metadata[^SAAM] in [CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model][^CIDOC].
