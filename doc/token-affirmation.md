<h2><i class="bi-bookmark-check-fill"></i> Historical Token Affirmation</h2>

With AI slop -low quality AI generated content- being spammed across
social and traditional media[^AI_SLOP] accompanied by employee AI
"workslop"[^WRK_SLOP], cultural heritage posses an unique asset with our paper and 
legacy electronic collections. We can attest that the text and other media 
from legacy collections remain consistent over time and can serve as validity 
checks for LLM outputs. We can also provide guidelines as more AI-generated and 
AI-assisted content is created from human and AI model activity at discrete 
points in time. 

We should embrace our traditional roles as gatekeepers and 
curators for collection development, acquiring new material as a filter between 
inferior and quality content—a way to promote our values to existing and 
emerging AI agents.

### Open Metadata's Role
How will GLAM institutions affirm the provenance of our collection? By extending and exposing our 
open metadata for use by AI agents. 

### Token Affirmation on RDF Triples
Single-token affirmation is neither practical nor desirable; however, affirming 
tokens at the statement level presents an opportunity for cultural heritage 
institutions. The core assertion of RDF graphs is the triple statement composed 
of subject, predicate, and object. Vectors of these statements can be 
generated from various models, and by publishing these vectors, institutions 
implicitly affirm that the source statements reflect their authority.
