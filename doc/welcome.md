## Welcome!
My name is Jeremy Nelson and I am software engineer in Stanford University 
Libraries Digital Libraries Systems and Services. Thank-you to the DCMI for
inviting me to talk about what I think is a critical 
role of Linked Open Data in the Generative AI ecosystem.

**DISCLAIMER:** All opinions and suppositions are my own do not necessarily reflect my
employer Stanford University Libraries views or policies. Also, generative AI was used in 
copy editing these remarks and for generating selected images.
