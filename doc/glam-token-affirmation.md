## GLAM Historical Token Affirmation
With AI Slop, low quality AI generated content, being spammed across
social and traditional media[^AI_SLOP] accompanied by employee AI
"workslop"[^WRK_SLOP], we cultural heritage have an unique asset with our paper and 
legacy electronic collections. We can attest that the text and other media 
are free from AI generation and provide a guidepost as more AI generated and AI
assisted content is generated from human and AI model activity. We should also
lean-in on our traditional roles as gatekeepers and curators for collection development
in acquiring new material as a filter between dross and quality material collections as way to promote
our values to existing and emerging AI agents.

### Open Metadata's Role
How will GLAM institutions affirm the provenance of our collection? By extending and exposing our 
open metadata.
