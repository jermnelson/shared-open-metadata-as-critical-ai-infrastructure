<h2><i class="bi-mic"></i> Introduction to Blue Core</h2>

The [Blue Core Project](https://bluecore.info/) is a collaborative endeavor by Cornell
University, University of Pennsylvania, Library of Congress, University
of California Davis, and Stanford University to build a shared store of
BIBFRAME Resources to enable linked data services that integrate
with a diverse set of institutional library services platforms.

The Blue Core project [prototype](https://dev.bcld.info) is finishing 
up this month with user and functional testing occuring over the next
few months with development starting on a MVP (Minimal viable project)
in early 2026. The full roll out to production is planned for 2027 with 
expanded number of institutions and a more robust and scalable infrastructure
to supporting access to hundreds of millions BIBFRAME Works and Instances 
available for use by everyone.
