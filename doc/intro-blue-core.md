<h2><i class="bi-mic"></i> Introduction to Blue Core</h2>

The [Blue Core Project](https://bluecore.info/) is a collaborative endeavor 
by Cornell University, University of Pennsylvania, Library of Congress, 
University of California Davis, and Stanford University. Together, these 
institutions are building a shared store of BIBFRAME resources to enable 
linked data services that integrate with diverse institutional library 
service platforms like FOLIO and Alma.

The Blue Core project [prototype](https://dev.bcld.info) will complete this 
month, followed by several months of user and functional testing. Development 
of an MVP (minimum viable product) will begin in early 2026, with full 
production rollout planned for 2027. The production system will expand 
to include additional institutions and feature a robust, scalable 
infrastructure supporting access to hundreds of millions of BIBFRAME Works 
and Instances available for use by everyone.
