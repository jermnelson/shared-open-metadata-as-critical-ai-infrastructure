<h2><i class="bi-robot"></i> AI Agents</h2>

Beyond text, image, audio, or video generation from direct user prompts, AI agents based on generative AI
pose both challenges and opportunities. 

Broadly defined, AI agents are software systems or programs that use 
AI models to reason and initiate actions and tasks toward one or more goals. In more complex workflows,
multiple AI agents coordinate work towards shared goals for the system. 

Web browsers that embed agents,
like Claude's Chrome browser extension[^1], allow these agents full access to the saved passwords and
websites and can initiate actions like filling out forms and performing other interactions with websites. 
Already these AI browsers present significant concerns in higher education where these browsers can log into 
learning management systems, respond to discussions, take quizzes, and simulate other student behavior
with little or no direction by the student.[^2] These new AI browsers present significant security threats 
and potential legal liability but also  offer significant time savings and productivity boosts for users 
automating their personal and professional workflows.

### Bot Attacks and Building for AI Agents
In the past year, AI bots have been overwhelming library and other cultural heritage websites[^3],
harvesting material including catalogs, institutional repositories, and other assets. Rosalyn Metz
in her blog post, *When Bots Meet Books*[^4], she recommends that libraries provide clear access
points for AI bots, restrict access to bad bots, encourage attribution of library collections, and
even explore new revenue models with AI companies.

AI Researcher and pundit Andrej Karpahty in a recent presentation[^5] talks about how software 
development has entered a new phase where we need to think of LLMs as analogous to computer's
operating systems and prompts (through AI Agents) are computer code. For libraries and other 
cultural heritage institutions to pivot services and collection for access and operations 
includes both internal and external AI Agents. One suggestion he recommends is to create 
specific markdown files that expose the content specifically for AI agents in an `llms.txt`[^5] files,
similar to a `sitemap` or `robots.txt` that directs LLMs to what content that to be harvested and 
ideally, reduce the traffic and demands on institutional web sites.
