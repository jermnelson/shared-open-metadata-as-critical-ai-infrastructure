## AI Agents

Beyond text, image, audio, or video generation from direct user prompts, AI agents based on generative AI
pose challenges and opportunities. 

Broadly defined, AI agents are software systems or programs that use 
AI models to reason and initiate actions and tasks towards one or more goals. In more complex workflows,
multiple AI agents coordinate work towards shared goals for the system. 

Web Browsers that embed agents,
like Claude's Chrome browser extension[^1], allow these agents full access to the saved passwords and
web sites and can initiate actions like filling forms and perform other interactions with websites. 
Already these AI browsers present significant concerns in higher education where these browsers can log into 
learning management systems, respond to discussions, take quizzes, and simulate other student behavior
with no or minimal direction by the student.[^2] These new AI browsers present significant security threats 
and potential legal liability but also  offer significant time savings and productivity boosts for users 
automating their personal and professional workflows.
