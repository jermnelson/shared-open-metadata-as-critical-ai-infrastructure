<h2><i class="bi-battery-charging"></i> People as AI's Mitochondria</h2> 

The consensus theory of the origins of mitochondria in living cells is *endosymbotic*.
Mitochondria were free-living organisms that were absorbed by a host cell to form 
a mutually beneficial eukaryotic cells, where mitochondria provide chemical energy to the host
cell, and the host cell provides protection and absorbed much of the mitochondria genetic
material.   

In a short article[^MITO_HUMANS], Steven Winkelstein notes how humans
are shifting from work-to-motion,

<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p>
    We now ferry information between systems: prompting a chatbot to generate a proposal, 
    copying that proposal into an email client, feeding its results into a dashboard or feedback tool. 
    We are still working, still "doing things," but much of our labor has become meta â€” less about meaning, 
    more about motion.
  </p>
</blockquote>

I have a more optimistic take, an aspiration for us humans is that we will become the equivalent of mitochondria 
in a world of AGI, bring our creativity and perspective as a key driver in the progression and context-building
for these future beings. Much like individual mitochondria in cells do not have a conception of the orders
of magnitudes larger biological structures like organs or organisms, we humans may not  be able to conceive 
or understand the functions, ecology, or economies of general super intelligence, our roles shift to becoming
the creative spark and historical context for future AI.
