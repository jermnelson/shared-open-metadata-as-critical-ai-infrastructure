# Shared Open Metadata as Critical AI Infrastructure

The explosive growth of Generative AI in recent years, attracting billions in 
investment dollars, is being applied across many areas of human endeavor. 
This development opens new opportunities and capacities but also raises concerns 
about Generative AI's tendency to hallucinate statements and facts in an 
authoritative manner. As a corrective to this tendency, one promising approach 
is to provide Large Language Models (LLMs) with graph-based knowledge bases 
in hybrid AI systems that ground LLM responses with factual statements about 
the world. With libraries, museums, archives, and other cultural heritage 
organizations increasingly representing their collections as graphs using 
ontologies such as BIBFRAME, we have an opportunity to serve as authoritative 
sources by offering shared knowledge bases about our cultures and world. Blue 
Core endeavors to provide such a shared, open knowledge base using the 
properties of open RDF-based metadata from contributing institutions, along 
with AI services to augment and support consumption by LLMs, thereby becoming 
a critical component of our communities' AI infrastructure.
